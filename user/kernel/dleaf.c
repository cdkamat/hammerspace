/*
 * Leaf index format
 *
 * A leaf has a small header followed by a table of extents.  A two level
 * index grows down from the top of the leaf towards the top of the extent
 * table.  The index maps each unique logical address in the leaf to one or
 * more extents beginning at that address.
 *
 * The top level index is a table of groups of entries all having the same
 * high 24 bits of logical address which is only stored once, along with the
 * 8 bit count of entries in the group.  Since there can be more than 256
 * entries at the same logical address, there could be more than one group
 * with the same logical address.  The group count is used both to know the
 * number of entries in the group and to find the beginning of the entry table
 * for a given group, by adding up the sizes of the proceeding groups.
 *
 * The 8 bit entry limit limits the number of different versions at the same
 * logical address to 255.  For now.
 *
 * The second level entry tables are stored end to end in reverse immediately
 * below the groups table, also stored in reverse.  Each entry has the low 24
 * bits of the logical address and the 8 bit 'limit' offset of the last extent
 * for that logical address, measuring from the first extent for the group in
 * units of extent size.  The limit is used rather than an offset so that the
 * final offset is the count of extents in the group, which is summed up to
 * locate the first extent for the group in the extent table.  The difference
 * between and entry limit and the limit of its predecessor gives the count of
 * extents for the logical address specified by the entry.
 *
 * At the top level of a very large or very sparse btree it is likely that the
 * group table will be relatively larger, up to the same size as all the entry
 * tables.  This does not matter much in terms of overall btree bulk.  A few
 * levels down the logical address space will have been split to the point
 * where most entries in a leaf fit into one entry table.
 *
 * This leaf indexing scheme has some obscure boundary conditions, such as
 * the zeroth entry of a group having no predecessor and thus needing to have
 * a special check to supply zero as the preceding limit.  Inserting and
 * deleting are fairly involved and subtle.  But the space required to index
 * extents in a deep btree is reduced considerably, which is compelling.  In
 * the end, the indexing scheme provides access to a simple linear table of
 * extents and a count, so there is little impact on the specialized methods
 * that operate on those extents due to the complexity of the indexing scheme.
 * The lookup operation on this index is very efficient.  Each level of the
 * index is suited to binary search.  A sequence of inserts in ascending order
 * in the same group requires no existing entries to be relocated, the reason
 * the entry list is stored in reverse.
